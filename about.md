# About

---

My name is Thomas Bates, I have a Bachelor's degree in Social Work from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.  I work daily with people currently and at risk of becoming homeless, and work to improve the coordination of the systems that serve them.  If you'd like to read more about my work, you can visit my [professional site](https://www.thomasbates.info/).

The thoughts I express here are my own, and do not represent my employer, groups of which I am a member, or any academic institutions where I study.
