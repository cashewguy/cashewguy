# About

---

My name is Thomas Bates, I have a Bachelor's degree in Social Work from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and am currently the (outgoing) Undergraduate Student Representative for the Illinois Chapter of the National Association of Social Workers.

I work daily with people currently and at risk of becoming homeless, and work to improve the coordination of the systems that serve them.

The thoughts I express here are my own, and do not represent UIUC, the NASW, or my employer.
