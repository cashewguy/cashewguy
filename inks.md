# Ink Collection

Here is a list of inks currently in my collection.

---

| Maker | Name | Review | Notes |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Waterman | Intense Black | Maybe! | I've bought countless bottles of this ink as I wrote exclusively with it for about 4 years. |
| Noodler's | Red | Unlikely | Purchased for editing/markup before I switched to blue inks for that.  Not my favorite ink, and I'd guess there's still 90% of the bottle left that I purchased in 2013. |
| Waterman | Mysterious Blue | Maybe! | Another ink that I've bought many bottles of. |
| Noodler's | Qternity | Maybe! | The ink that upset Waterman as my daily for a while. |
| Diamine | Sherwood Green | Maybe! | A lovely green ink that I really like. |
| Pelikan | Brilliant Brown | Maybe! | Purchased after seeing a reddit user's drawing.  I still usually have this in a pen. |
| Pilot | Iroshizuku Kon-Peki | Maybe! | One of my favorite inks, I bought this for my Van Gogh and almost always have the pen inked with it. |
| Montblanc | Midnight Blue | Maybe! | I bought this for my 149 and usually keep it in something for signatures. |
| Monteverde | Coral | Maybe! | This was thrown into a pen_swap order.  It's a nice ink but it has an attrocious smell that keeps me from putting it in anything nice. |
| Troublemaker | Sinulog Black | Maybe! | A nice black ink that I have in my VHS currently. |
| Troublemaker | Basilica Red | Maybe! | The ink I now use for editing, in my VAC-700R. |
| Vanness | Good Evening | Maybe! | A nice recreation of MB's Hitchcock, it's been in my 149 for a while and looks just like writing in blood.  Bit creepy. |
| Jacques Herbin | Ã‰meraude de Chivor | Probably! | This was gifted to me by BBVP CosmicHobo in the 2019 Secret Santa.  I've always heard amazing things about this ink and I love its bottle design and the way it looks on paper.  I used it in my 1.9mm Lamy Safari to label gifts this year. |
| Random Allocation | Frostbite | Maybe! | A lovely grey from Modern Beaker / Random Allocation sent to me for a birthday from BBVP Jess.  Currently in my Hero 9038. |
| Random Allocation | Pride | Maybe! | A very cool bluey-purple from Modern Beaker / Random Allocation sent to me for a birthday from BBVP Jess.  Currently in my Jinhao x450. |
