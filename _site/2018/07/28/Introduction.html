        <h2 id="why-write">Why write?</h2>

<p>There are a lot of content sources available today.  It’s a little arrogant for someone to think that what they have to say might be worth writing down at all, let alone posting to an webpage.  Then again, it’s something that has become more and more common over the last few decades.  What used to be restricted to columnists in newspapers is now available to anyone who can setup a Facebook page or WordPress blog. (…)</p>

<p>I’m setting this up because I like writing, and I like thinking about things.  It’s become common for people to get sucked into the vortex of headlines, to read little, and to think little about what they do read.  In the United States, our Republic depends on an informed electorate.  For me to consider myself informed, I need to read, think, and write to process.  I’m choosing to do so here so that I have a record of this.  It’s not for anyone or anything, just for myself.</p>

<p>I also like and collect fountain pens, watches, and I read a lot.  Sometimes, I might write about those things.</p>
